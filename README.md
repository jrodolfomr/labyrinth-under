# LABYRINTH  Under A Bored Cat

## Game's Page https://jrodolfomr.github.io/labyrinth-under  

A Labyrinth Puzzle Game where the main objective is to escape the maze through a series of obstacles, obtaining points along the way. Many hazards are present, and many abilities sush like breaking walls and teleportation, among other features. Avoid the spiders in order to survive the game.

The game has two modes, one where you can roam freely throughout the levels of the game, and the other where you have to solve the puzzle of not going through the same place twice.

In order to help with the difficulty of the game, a backtrack feature is implemented, which allows you to go back one step at a time.



## Controls [Keyboard]:

- **Directional Arrows** to move the character.
- **Backspace** to backtrack one step at a time.

#### When using the directional and warp spaces:
- **Directional Arrows** to select how to move. (In case of direction you have to choose the space indicated by the arrow, in case of teleportation you have to move to another teleportation space)
- **Enter** to confirm destination

Also there is a button on the bottom of the screen to **change the mode** of the game. Once pressed the player will be returning to level 1 and lose all progress of previous steps.
